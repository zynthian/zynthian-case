# 3D-printed case / RPi 4 / Waveshare 3.5"
The case design is created with the setup as described below, but I have also included the source file (Fusion 360) before all cutouts and joins, so it can easily be adapted to other setups.

My setup:
 + RPi 4 main board
 + HifiBerry DAC+ with phone jack
 + All-in-One controller / V2
 + Waveshare 3.5" touch screen

The case is designed so that each part prints separately, so you get the nice and smooth structure on all visible surfaces. I use the Prusa sintered build plate, looks fantastic.

The side parts are designed in such a way that they could be replaced by wooden parts instead. My goal is to create these in either cherry or oak at some point. But for now I printed them with Wood PLA to make it stand out a little.

Printing tip: For the bottom and top parts, avoid using the standard Rectilinear fill, it's much better to use a stiffer infill, like Cubic (in Prusa Slicer). This way there is a bigger chance that the edges will not detach from the buildplate during printing. In reality they probably will anyway, but usually to a smaller degree - it's difficult to print these large parts perfectly.
