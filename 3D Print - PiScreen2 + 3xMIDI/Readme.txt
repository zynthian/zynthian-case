This box is a modification of the 3D printed case for Zynthian V2. No serigraphy, only the Zynthian logo.
It has 3 Midi connectors and a stereo 6,35 jack for the auxiliary output.
The union of the two parts of the case is made by insert nuts (4mm outside diameter). You can push them with the soldering iron.
There are two versions of the encoder knobs: 4mm (for insert nuts) and 3mm holes . In both cases use ad M3 screw without head for a perfect fit.
